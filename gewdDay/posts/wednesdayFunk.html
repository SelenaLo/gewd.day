<p>This was my very first surf edit. Super janky, but nonetheless, one of my proudest accomplisments. I filmed this with my family's old Sony camcorder that used mini dvds. I remember looking to buy more dvds and not finding them anymore except on eBay. Yeah
Yeah. super old stuff. This morning was interesting. It was my first time ever really offering to film clips, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing. I though <i>how hard could this be? i'm just filming</i> but it was tough. everyone looks exactly the same -- all black wetsuits, shortboards, and blondish hair. and it didn't help that the waves were pumping, so it was crowded as heck. Even before I got "set up," I had the hardest time. I was meeting my friends there, but I didn't know that they were a mile down the beach, so I wasn't prepared to trek a mile down the beach at 6ish am. Besides me totally being lost, but I had a bio test that day and I stayed out there so long that I missed it. Well i guess that's what i'll miss about online school -- easily skipping class and blaming it on wifi.

<p>Editing the clips was an entirely different beast. My little baby edit is only a minute or so long. Imagine the time and eye strain that the people behind like Ch.11 dedicate. Insane. Picking out the music alone was both extremely fun, but tiring. You would think that would be so easy, but you can't just pick your favorite song. It has to match the vibe and speed of the clips and truly create the ambiance that you envison for the viewer. For me, I didn't even know that at first, but after watching hours of Ch.11, I realized how bad mine is haha. If the clips are way killer and super fast and rad, I, personally, would do something rockish and pumping -- especially if it's of shortboarders; however, if it's loggers, then some really groovy psych rock is well suited for it. I bet there's way more to it, but that's just my thoughts so far. Because I filmed on such an old camera that uses mini dvds, the process of downloading the clips was TERRIBLE. I had to download a seperate program and direclty connect the camcorder to my laptop and download these clips that took up so much storage. After doing that, I'd have to download each of the clips to the computer and then upload them onto my Google Drive, so that I could access them onto my other computer. Not a super efficent process. </p>
