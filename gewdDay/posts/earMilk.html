    <h2>ear milk</h2>
    <p>Up until about the summer before junior year, I listened to the same 8 songs on repeat-- all off them being Disney. I vividly remember gaining music consciousness, persay, when my sister and I were driving up to Ventura in our family's 2001 Toyota Sienna. My phone bugged out and started playing "Way it Goes" by Hippo Campus. So flipping groovy. After that, I was on a search for more similar music (aka "indie" [I hate using that term for music because I feel like it's been so overused and worn out]). I'm a creature of habit, so I didn't get <i>too</i> wild. I became wildly obsessed with Hippo Campus, and they became all that I listened to. Soon after, my Spotify eventually led me to Bad Suns, Sales, Boy Pablo, etc. style</p>
    <p>My music taste has definately evolved, but still holds strong roots in my past playlists. I eventually got super into Tame Impala, and I would genuinely have to say that he is my forever favorite. I have never and will never do drugs or drink alcohol, but his music is the closest that I'll ever get to feeling what it's like to be absolutely zooted. I love it. It's crazy how music -- ear milk -- creates people's entire personalities, interests, and moods. For example, majority of the people at my job religiously listen to rock. They all skate/surf and are so freaking chill. And yes, their music has grown on me, which is why I am so obsessed with classic rock now. I wish I was alive during the 70s. Imagine just sneaking into a Jefferson Airplane concert and just totally rocking out. </p>
    <p>If I had to describe what kind of music I listen to I don't even know what to say. It's not because I listen to so many different genres, but because I genuinely don't know the names. There's categories like garage rock, which I didn't even know existed. But I guess to generalize my daily mix it'd be rock? There are so many different kinds that I don't even know. I guess the type of rock depends on my mood. I freaking LOVE the Beatles when I'm driving, doing chores, or feeling nostalgic? in some sense ... I don't know. But when I'm just feeling so groovy and funky, the BeeGees are my jam. I don't want to keep rambling about stuff that I don't even know too much about, so just check out my spotify and give it a listen if you want. </p>
    <p>This entry is titled ear milk cause milk makes us strong and cool. Music makes us strong and cool. So music is basically milk for our ears. Also it just sounds rad.</p>
