  <h1>Expired film :/</h1>
  <body>
<p>My first roll of film. I was decluttering the closet and ended up finding my parents' old Olympus is-20 Quartzdate. I thought it was so rad because I was looking at film cameras around them, but I didn't want to dump out some of my own money for one yet cause what if I didn't even like it? Then I'd be $50 short and a failed "photographer." On top of my luck of finding the camera, I was crazy stoked to find a roll still in the camera. All  I needed were some batteries that literally no place sold because the camera was ancient, but after that, it was all fun.</p>
<p>The funny thing about film (especially for a beginner [or maybe it was just me]) is that since it requires so many parts -- the camera, batteries, film, and developing the roll -- so it can all add up in the end. Since I didn't want to waste my roll, I was so paranoid about possibly "wasting" a shot. This led to me rarely ever taking photos or being such a perfectionist about trying to get those super cool candids. It probably took me about 1-2 months to finish the roll. And let me remind you that it wasn't a brand new 36-exposure roll.  </p>
<p>I was pretty psyched when I got my first roll developed (partially because I couldn't recognize how bad I was) because it was like Christmas morning. I had a decent idea of what was there, but I didn't really know what was going to be there. I loved, and still love, the look of expired film. The warped colors are wickedly rad, and I love how my foolishness in exposing the roll to light made some of the edges burn. Along with tons of beach pics, I didn't expect to be hit with some mega throwbacks. Super cool, right?! There's so much about this roll that I detest, yet love.  </p>
<p>Honestly, I still am trying to shake that film frugal mindset because it truly inhibits the raw nature of film. Hopefully you guys can see my progress in future Gewd Day posts. While we're both waiting for my next rolls to be developed, check out my super forced and crappy first roll.</p>
